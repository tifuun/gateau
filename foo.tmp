This file contains all the hairy details that ideally should be
of no concern for users and casual contributors,
but are important for maybetree, Arend, and whatever poor souls
who will have to carry the burden of maintaining Gateau in the future.

## Manual Compiling

The general procedure for compiling Gateau
from this repo is like so:

1. Install Python, gcc, cmake, `gsl-devel` using your system package manager.
    - `gsl-devel` is usually called `libgsl-dev`
        on Debian-like distros.
1. (optional) create and activate venv
1. `pip install -e .`

Pip should automatically compile `libgateau.so`
(which is placed under `src/gateau/libgateau.so`
when installing in pip's Editable mode)
using cmake.
After compilation is done,
you can verify that things work using `unittest`.
Note that some tests will always fail if you don't
have a GPU that gateau can use:

1. `python -m unittest`


## For developers: using the `test-all.sh` script

Building, testing, and packaging Gateau requires a very hairy toolchain
and some rather counterintuitive command line incantations.
To make our lives easier, we have written a script which automates
all of this using Podman.

If you've never used podman before,
consider reading the section
[A Brief Introduction to Podman](#a-brief-introduction-to-podman)
at the bottom of this document.

Here's how to use it:

1. Install and set up `podman` using your system's package manager
1. Set up `podman` for use with CUDA.
    Read [NVIDIA's docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/cdi-support.html)
    or the [STRATAL SYSTEMS Wiki page](https://github.com/stratal-systems/wiki/blob/main/wiki/void-linux-cuda.md)
    for instructions on how to do this.
    - If you do not have a GPU,
        you can skip this step and
        instead run the script with
        `GATEAU_DISABLE_GPU=1`.
        Things that require a GPU will of course fail,
        but things like compiling and packaging
        will still work.
1. Run `./podman/test-all.sh pull` to download all of the containers
    needed for testing, building, and packaging Gateau.
    - Alternatively, you can use `./podman/test-all.sh build`
        to build the containers locally

What follows below is a brief cookbook of things you can do
with the `test-all.sh` script.
If you want a complete documentation of what
it does and how,
read the
[comment block at the start of the script itself](./podman/test-all.sh)

### Run the test suite

```
./podman/test-all.sh test11
```
Will run the full test suite under a cuda11 container
with multiple versions of Python.
The detailed output will be placed in `/podman/output` directory.

If you do not have a GPU, you can still run the tests like this:

```
GATEAU_DISABLE_GPU=1 ./podman/test-all.sh test11
```

Mosts tests will fail if there is no GPU.

Run tests in only one specific version of Python:

```
GATEAU_TEST_VENVS="/venv3.9" ./podman/test-all.sh test11
```

### Build a wheel

```
./podman/test-all.sh staticwheel
```

This will build wheel and place it into the `dist` subdirectory.

If you are paranoid, you can run `./podman/test-all.sh checkstatic`
to verify that the wheel has libgsl linked statically
(more info in the [Libgsl](#libgsl) section).

### Upload to pypi

This will upload all of the wheels and source archives under `dist`
onto PyPI.
You will need to pass your PyPI token using the `TWINE_PASSWORD`
environment variable.
You can make a token in the pypi webui.

```
TWINE_USERNAME=__token__ TWINE_PASSWORD=pypi-xxxxxxx ./podman/test-all.sh pypi
```

### Test the PyPI package

This will download the latest Gateau from PyPI,
install it, and run the test suite.
As with the `test11` subcommand,
the detailed output will be available under `podman/output`.

```
./podman/test-all.sh test-pypi
```

### Upload/test on TestPyPI

There exists a "playground" version of PyPI
at <https://test.pypi.org/>.
You can use it to play around with the Gateau packaging process.
Instead of using the `pypi` and `test-pypi`
subcommands,
use the `tpypi` and `test-tpypi` subcommands
to target TestPyPI instead.

### Re-build image

If you would like to re-build a specific image,
simply `untag` or `rm` it,
then run the `build` subcommand again.
For example, to re-build the `gateau-cuda11bare` image:

```
podman untag gateau-cuda11
./podman/test-all.sh build
```

It's worth noting that the `pull` subcommand
ALWAYS overrides the local images with the remote images,
regardless of which on is newer.

## For developers: building and publishing wheels

The wheel building and publishing process is automated using the
`test-all.sh` script,
please read
[the section on using it](#for-developers-using-the-test-allsh-script).
Otherwise, you can follow the manual instructions below:

To build wheels for gateau and upload to pypi
you will need all of the requirements for compiling
Gateau
(see the [Compiling section](#manual-compiling)),
plus the `twine` and `build` Python packages.

1. Make sure the package version specified in `pyproject.toml`
    is the version number that you want to publish.
1. Build wheel: run `python -m build` from the root of the repo.
    The results (`.whl` wheel and `.tag.gz` source archive)
    are placed into the `dist` subdirectory.
1. Fix name of wheel:
    ~~For some godforsaken reason~~ `build` generates wheel files
    that are named like `gateau-0.1.0-cp313-cp313-linux_x86_64.whl`,
    which PyPI WILL NOT ACCEPT.
    You need to change the part that says `linux_x86_64`
    into `manylinux_<majver>_<minver>`, where
    `<majver>` and `<minver>` are the version numbers of GNU libc.
    So for example if `build` generates a file named
    `gateau-0.1.0-cp313-cp313-linux_x86_64.whl`,
    and `ldd --version` tells you that you have
    `ldd (Ubuntu GLIBC 2.31-0ubuntu9.12) 2.31`,
    then you need to rename the file to
    `gateau-0.1.0-cp313-cp313-manylinux_2_31_x86_64.whl`.
    Read [this PEP](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/#file-name-convention)
    for more info.
1. Upload to pypi:
    There are many ways to authenticate to pypi, but the easiest is to
    create an access token in the webui
    and pass it to `twine` via the `TWINE_PASSWORD` environment variable:
    `TWINE_USERNAME=__token__ TWINE_PASSWORD=pypi-xxxxxxx twine upload --verbose --skip-existing --non-interactive dist/*`

## Libgsl

In Python Land, it is customary to statically
link dependencies into the wheel.
Our only dependency (besides C and C++ stdlibs,
which are halal to link dynamically afaik)
is the
[GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).
We link it statically into `libgateau.so`.
In order to accomplish this,
a static version of libgsl
itself is needed -- i.e. `libgsl.a` instead of `libgsl.so`.
Some distros provide a package for this,
but not Ubuntu (which is the base for the `gateau-cicd` container).
So we compile static libgsl manually.
This is done using the `scripts/build-gsl.sh` script,
which runs during the `staticwheel`
subcommand of the `test-all.sh` script.
That script has a little
non-trivial hackery to actually get libgsl to compile,
go take a look yourself,
I promise it's not that scary.

cmake is duumb. I have spent like an hour trying to figure out
how to tell it to link libgsl statically
and the best I have come up with is to just make
sure the container ONLY has the static libgsl (`libgsl.a`).
If the container has both static and dynamic (`libgsl.so`),
cmake defaults to the dynamic one no matter what I do.
This is the reason why the `build-gsl.sh` script
configures libgsl with `--distable-shared`,
and why the `staticwheel` subcommand has
that cheeky `rm -rf /usr/local/bin/libgsl.so*`,
and why there is the paranoid `checkstatic` subcommand as well.

Libgsl is licensed under GPLv3 which is the reason
we must use a GPL-compatible license for Gateau itself
if we want to distribute static wheels of it.

## CICD

We have somewhat of a CICD pipeline.
See the
[stratal systems wiki page](https://github.com/stratal-systems/wiki/blob/main/wiki/gateau-cicd.md)
for full info.

### Publishing pages

The documentation is published to the
[pages site](https://tifuun.github.io/gateau/)
automatically.
To trigger it you should:

1. Tag the commit you want to publish
1. Push the tag to github
1. Push the commit to either `main` or `cicdtest` branches.

> [!WARNING]
> You must FIRST push the TAG and THEN push the COMMIT.
> Otherwise minicycle will pull the commit
> before it has the tag
> and skip building pages.
> So roughly:
> ```
> git commit -m "Updated the docs"
> git tag 'v4.2.0'
> git push --tags
> git push
> ```

### Running tests (CI)

The automatic tests pipeline
runs on ANY commit to `master` or `cicdtest`.
Read the 
[stratal systems wiki page](https://github.com/stratal-systems/wiki/blob/main/wiki/gateau-cicd.md)
for full info.

### Publishing to pypi (CD)

There is no automated way to publish to pypi yet.

### Internals

All pipelines start at `./.minicycle/entrypoint`
which then launches `./.minicycle/tests`,
and, if a tag is present,
`./.minicycle/pages`.
They both make use of the `./podman/test-all.sh` script
to run tests / build the docs.
The docs are ultimately built by `./scripts/GenerateDocs.py`.

The docs are published to github pages by having
the pipeline push the built docs to the `gh-pages`
branch in this repo through a read-write deploy key.
Do not push to `gh-pages` branch manually.

## Misc. notes for various linux distros

### Void Linux

- no clue about getting cuda to work, but that
    is not needed to just compile
- `xbps-install -Syu gcc cmake gsl-devel`

### Oracle Linux 9

- Available pythons: 3.9, 3.11, 3.12
- Extra repos need to be added for googletest:

```
dnf install -y oracle-epel-release-el9
dnf config-manager --set-enabled ol9_developer_EPEL
dnf install -y gtest gtest-devel gsl-devel python3.11

python3.11 -m venv /venv
source /venv/bin/activate

pip install -e .
python -m unittest
TODO gtest
```

### Ubuntu 20.04

- `deadsnakes` repo needed for non-ancient Pythons
    - contains almost all releases of python that you might
        ever want (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13)
    - `venv` shipped separately,
        so you need to install both
        `pythonX.XX` and `pythonX.XX-venv`
- `gsl-devel` is called `libgsl-dev`
- TODO gtest

```
apt install -y libgsl-dev software-properties-common
add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
apt update -y
apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv

python3.11 -m venv /venv
source /venv/bin/activate

pip install -e .
python -m unittest
TODO gtest
```

## Other misc notes for developers

### Changing the signature of `run_gateau`

If you want to add/remove arguments of `run_gateau` there's
four places you need to change it:

- `InterfaceCUDA.h`
- `SimKernels.cu`
- `bindings.py` -- the Python function itself
- `bindings.py` -- the call to the C++ code

## A Brief Introduction to Podman

Podman is a container engine.
It allows setting up isolated environments with their own set
of programs and dependencies.
Think `venv` but for everything, not just Python.
Think virtual machine,
but running on the same kernel.
Think Linux-in-a-Box.

Podman works based on layers.
For example, you can use a pre-made image,
such as
[Alpine Linux 3.22.1](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/alpine/3.22/),
and install the things you want on top of it.

When you use `podman run`, Podman takes a specified image
and spawns a container based on that image.
"Container" just means "running image".
The changes in the container won't affect its image,
because they are also on a separate layer.

- Installation: typically through your system package manager
	- Debain 12 also requires the `containers-storage` package,
		because of
		[this](https://github.com/stratal-systems/wiki/blob/main/wiki/podman-storage-driver.md).
- List running containers: `podman ps`
- List running and stopped containers: `podman ps -a`
- List tagged images: `podman image ls`
- List all images: `podman image ls -a`
- Stop container: `podman stop <ID-OR-NAME>`
- Kill container: `podman kill <ID-OR-NAME>`
- Reset all podman data: `podman system reset`
- Show podman system information: `podman info`
- Remove stopped container: `podman container rm <ID-OR-NAME>`
- Remove image: `podman image rm <ID-OR-TAG>`
- Remove all stopped containers: `podman container prune`
- Remove all images not in use by a container:
	`podman image prune`
- Run interactive shell inside container:
	`podman exec -ti <ID-OR-NAME> sh`
- Start a new container from an image with an interactive shell,
	removing the container once the shell exits.
	`podman run --rm -ti <IMAGE-ID-OR-TAG> sh`
- Start a new container from an image with an interactive shell
	and a custom name, removing any stopped container
	that already has the same name:
	`podman run --name foobar --replace -ti <IMAGE-ID-OR-TAG> sh`

## Windows

Unfortunately, Gateau supports Windows.
You can make a windows build of Gateau using
the `./win/scripts/build-in-vm.sh` script,
which launches a windows virtual machine and builds Gateau inside it.
The prerequisites for using the `build-in-vm.sh` script are detailed below.
The script also contains checks for all of these,
so it should be fine to just run
and it will tell you what you need to do.

1. *Acquire the VM image.*
	We have made a pre-built windows 10 image with
	everything needed to build Gateau inside of it.
	The image is located in `win/vm/5.final.qcow2`
	and managed using [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/).
	You can download it in the following steps:

	1. Install `git-annex` from your system's package manager
	1. Initialize your repo for use with annex: `git annex init`
	1. Sync annex metadata: `git annex sync origin`
	1. Enable the remote containing the image:
		`WEBDAV_USERNAME=tifuun WEBDAV_PASSWORD="xxx" git annex enableremote dav`
		- Ask maybetree for the password.
			Due to licensing issues, we cannot distribute
			our windows 10 image publicly.
	1. Download the image: `git annex get win/vm/5.final.qcow2`
		- The image weighs 40GB and the server is slow,
			so it will take some time
		- In case git-annex complains about a "stalled transfer",
			just let it finish its job don't CTRL+C it.
1. *Acquire python deps.*
	We freeze all of the python dependendencies for the windows
	version of gateau.
	Once you've set up git-annex as detailed above,
	run `git annex get win/pipcache`
	to download them.
	- If you would like to bump the python depenencies to their latest
		versions available on pypi, simply clear out the
		`win/pipcache` directory, run
		`win/scripts/compile_requirements.sh` script
		followed by `win/scripts/download_wheels.sh` script.
		
		When you make a new commit, make sure to track the
		bumped versions with git-annex instead of checking
		them directly into git:
		run `git annex add win/pipcache` to put them in the annex,
		then make the git commit as usual,
		then `git annex copy --to dav win/pipcache` to upload them
		to our annex remote,
		and finally `git annex sync origin` to update
		metadata about the new files' presence.

1. *Install systemwide deps.*
	In order to run the emulator,
	you need to install `qemu-system-x86_64`,
	`virtiofsd`, `jq`, and `socat`.
	These are very standard programs likely available thru
	your system's package manager.
	- Alpine Linux users are also encouraged to install
		`gnu-libiconv` package
		so that the script can descramble Russian error messages
		coming from the VM.

1. *Run the script.*
	Once everything is in order,
	brace yourself for the windows bootloader jumpscare and
	run `./win/scripts/build-in-vm.sh`.
	Although the VM runs with a virtual display, it will
	just show the login prompt.
	Keep and eye on the console output for information.
	If all goes well, the built wheels
	should end up in `dist`.

### Technical details on the windows build script

- If error or unexpected condition is required,
	script will shut down vm gracefully.
	Pass `GATEAU_DEBUG` to add a pause before
	the shutdown, it can be useful for debugging.

- Script creates a read-write overlay of the vm image
	in `win/tmp/overlay.qcow2`, so changes across vm
	runs persist. Simply delete the overlay file,
	and the next run of the vm will be fresh from the original
	`win/vm/5.final.qcow2` image.

- Username and password for the VM: `maybetree` and `abundance`.
	- Make sure to switch keyboard to english
		by pressing CTRL+SHIFT at the login prompt.

- Although Windows contains a networking stack and networking hardware drivers,
	it is essentially an offline-only operating system,
	because any connection to the internet will cause it to download
	and autoinstall updates which will likely if not certainly
	brick it.
	Therefore, do not connect the VM to the internet.
	You can use virtiofs to share files between the guest and host,
	or, import the image into `virt-manager`
	where you can set up an isolated network that lets guest see the host
	but not the outside internet.
