\section intro_sec Introduction
Welcome to the documentation pages for `TiEMPO2`! This is a Python package designed to simulate astronomical signals through the atmosphere.

`TiEMPO2` is designed to be an improvement over its predecessor `TiEMPO` \cite Huijten2022.
These improvements are:
- Offloading the heavy lifting to a parallel C++/CUDA implementation.
- More flexible interface for interchanging astronomical sources.
- Flexible interface for applying atmospheric subtraction algorithms, such as ABBA chopping.
- Enhanced structure, tests and code documentation, facilitating smooth future development.
- More elaborate scanning strategies, allowing for the simulation of extended celestial sources.

\section install Installation
Clone repos:
```
git clone <repo>
```

Navigate to cloned repo and:
```
pip install -e .
```

`TiEMPO2` can be run on Nvidia GPUs. For this, CUDA 11 or higher needs to be installed. There are plenty of resources [online](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-e&q=install+cuda) on how to do this. 
When running the above pip install command, the installer will look for a valid CUDA compiler and for valid runtime libraries. When found, the CUDA libraries for `TiEMPO2` are compiled.
