File containing the threadmanager class for TiEMPO2.
This class is responsible for launching heavy calculations on a separate daemon thread,
preventing the program from becoming unresponsive and allowing for Ctrl-c keyboard escapes.

    This class generates a threadmanager object.
    The manager can start daemon threads and signal when the thread is finished.
    This class is only used to spawn calls to the C++ backend inside a daemon thread so that Python keeps control over the process.
    This allows users to Ctrl-c a running calculation in C++ from Python.
