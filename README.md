Welcome to the `gateau` Github repository:
the GPU-Accelerated Time-dEpendent observAtion simUlator! 
This is the end-to-end simulator for TIFUUn observations,
and is currently still in progress.
For more info, please see
[the documentation pages](https://arend95.github.io/tiempo2/) (to be fixed).

## Installation

Gateau is available from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/gateau/).
You can install it like any other python package:

```
pip install gateau
```

> [!WARNING]
> You must also install the
> [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
> (Often called `gsl` or `libgsl`) for Gateau to run properly.
> We will fix this in the future.


### Supported Platforms

We currently only support Linux with GNU libc
(known as `manylinux` in the Python world).
We do not ship wheels for other operating systems
or linuxes with other libc implementations.
If you want to get gateau working on one of these platforms,
have a read of [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md)
(and please let us know if you're interested in helping
us get gateau running on other platforms!).
